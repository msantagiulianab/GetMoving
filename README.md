# Get Moving

Get Moving is an `Android app` that allows `the user` to `keep track of each workout`.
Once you have signed in, you can start populating the list with exercises.
Each exercise will have a date, a name, a number of repetitions (or km), and a location.
This data is safely stored locally on your device.
At any time you can quickly open the camera from within Get Moving app and take a selfie!
